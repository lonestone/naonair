### Docker

Docker is used in dev to start database; but too in staging and production

### Database

We using a PostgreSQL database in order to store main data of apps. Running at `localhost:5432`

# Getting started

## Install dependencies

Go in each project and run `yarn` command.

For nest, you need to install `@nestjs/cli` in global (or locally, as you want)

## Run Database

You need docker, and run `docker-compose up -d` for running database

## Configure environment

```
# go in api folder
$ cd api

# copy example to right file (don't commit it!)
$ cp .env.example .env

```

Then, fill right properties

## Start projects

```
# API
$ yarn start // or start:dev to hot reload

# Backoffice
$ yarn start

# Mobile app - Metro server
$ yarn start

# Mobile app - Run on android
